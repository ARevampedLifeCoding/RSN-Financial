# RSN Stock Selector

We have built a stock selector that will allow you to chose a stock with the most up to date stock information. We also allow you to change the currency to the currency of your preference.

## Functionality

Use our stock search tool to search trough all the available stocks. Then you will have the option to add the stock to your list or you can look at more. This is where you would change the currency to your preference.
